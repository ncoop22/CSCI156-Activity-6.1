Chapter 6 – day 1

1. Write a function corners() that will take two parameters m and n and returns a string with m+1 plus signs each of which 
are separated by n dashes. So corners(3,2) would return +--+--+--+ and corners(1,5) would return +-----+

2. Write a function vertical() that will take two parameters m and n and returns a string with m+1 vertical bars each of 
which are separated by n spaces. So vertical(3,2) would return |  |  |  | and vertical(1,5) would return |     |

3. Write a function boxes(m,n,width,height) which will print a box divided into m boxes horizontally and n boxes vertically. 
The horizontal boxes are width “width”, the vertical boxes are height “height”. boxes() will corners() and vertical().
